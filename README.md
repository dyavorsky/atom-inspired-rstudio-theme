You can try out this theme by running the following in R:

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/dyavorsky/atom-inspired/blob/main/atom_inspired.rstheme"
rstudioapi::addTheme(url, apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```

This will appear in *Tools \> Global Options \> Appearance \> Editor Theme* as **One Dark {Inspired}**

If you have issues applying the theme programatically, try this instead:

 - Download the *atom_inspired.rstheme* file from this github repo
 - Go to RStudio's Tools > Global Options > Appearance
 - Under Editor Theme, click "Add"
 - Select the *atom_inspired.rstheme* file from it's location on your machine
 - Click "Apply"

To remove this theme, go to RStudio's Tools > Global Options > Appearance and click "Remove" or simply run

```{r}
rstudioapi::removeTheme("One Dark {Inspired}")
```
